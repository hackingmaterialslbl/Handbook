# Group meetings

There a few types of group meetings that you should make sure you have calendar invitations for:

* Biweekly meetings with Anubhav – these are 30-minute, 1:1 meetings where we discuss your project and anything else you'd like to discuss
* Biweekly "Teach Me Anything Day" group meetings – our entire research group meets for 1 hour every two weeks and someone in the group (sometimes Anubhav) presents on any topic of their choosing.
* Project meetings – your specific project will likely have some kind of recurring meetings
* Finally, we have biannual "Group Day" meetings that are scheduled a month or so in advance (so no calendar invite until they happen). These are longer group meetings where we present our research projects to one another.
