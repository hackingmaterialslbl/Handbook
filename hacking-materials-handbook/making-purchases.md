# Making purchases

You are encouraged to make purchases that are likely to save you a lot of time. For example, if a commercial version of a software is superior to open-source alternatives, then you should purchase the commercial version. Your time is valuable and if we can solve a problem with funds, then we should try to do so.

Purchases are usually paid for through **project ids** that Anubhav can provide you with. For items less than $100, you should initiate purchases on your own provided that you know the correct project id (just let Anubhav know afterward so he is aware of the charge). For items greater than $100, contact Anubhav first.

There are also a couple of important things to know about purchases that may be different than a university department:&#x20;

* It can be very difficult if not impossible to “pay first, get reimbursed later” if you don’t have the prior pre-authorization. For example, if your lab computer breaks, don’t just take it to the Apple store, pay out of pocket for a $300 repair, and then expect the lab will reimburse you later. Similarly, don’t make a purchase with personal funds and expect the lab can authorize you for that purchase later. If you have questions, contact Anubhav.
* Note that you are also not allowed to make any commitments or changes to a purchase request on the lab’s behalf. For example, if you’ve already gotten authorization for a purchase but then need to change the shipping address, need to change the date the item is received, or make any further changes, it’s actually the lab’s “buyer” that needs to negotiate that. This is all a little complicated; you can refer to Procurement's [Aquisition Planning](https://procurement.lbl.gov/epro/acquisition-planning/#unauthorized) or talk to Anubhav if confused.

The procedure for making purchases depends on the purchase type:&#x20;

* **Software:** Many popular commercial software libraries (e.g., Microsoft Office) can be purchased through the lab's [software portal](https://software.lbl.gov). At check out, the approver for the purchase is Amapola Comayas.&#x20;
* **Office supplies, computer accessories:** Check the LBNL’s Ebuy (not Ebay) first via the lab's [Procurement site](https://procurement.lbl.gov). If the item or an equivalent is available, this is the easiest way to make the purchase (for both you and LBNL administration). At check out, the approver for the purchase is Amapola Comayas. Otherwise, see below.&#x20;
* **Books:** First check if the book is available on Ebuy (see above) - this is the simplest purchase option. If it’s not available on Ebuy or it is much more expensive on Ebuy than from another seller, follow the instructions below for “other purchases”.&#x20;
* **Other purchases:** For other purchases, please review fill out the purchase request form on the [ESDR admin](https://sites.google.com/a/lbl.gov/esdradmin/?pli=1) web site.
