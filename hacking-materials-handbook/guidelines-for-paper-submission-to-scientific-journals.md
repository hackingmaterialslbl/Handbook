# Guidelines for Paper Submission to Scientific Journals

As part of our commitment to disseminating our research effectively, it is important to follow a set of guidelines when preparing to submit papers to scientific journals. These guidelines not only ensure wider visibility of our work but also align with the standards of the scientific community. Below are the key guidelines to follow:

#### Pre-Submission to Preprint Servers

1. **Early Preprint Submission**:
   * **ArXiv/ChemRxiv Submission**: It is recommended to submit the paper to a relevant preprint server such as arXiv or ChemRxiv at least 3 months before submitting it to a journal. This practice helps in disseminating your findings early to the community and allows for initial feedback and discussions that can enhance the quality of your paper.
   * **Exception for High-Impact Work**: If the work is assessed (by you and Anubhav) to have the potential for acceptance in a high-impact journal (with an impact factor greater than 20), this rule may be bypassed. The rationale is to prioritize direct journal submission for groundbreaking work to streamline the publication process in top-tier journals.

#### Additional Guidelines for Journal Submission

2. **Journal Selection**:
   * Carefully select a journal that aligns well with the theme and scope of your research. Consider factors such as the journal's audience, impact factor, and the type of articles it publishes.
3. **Follow Journal Guidelines**:
   * Adhere strictly to the author guidelines provided by the journal. This includes formatting, length, style, and submission process.
4. **Peer Review Readiness**:
   * Ensure that your paper is ready for peer review. This includes thorough proofreading, ensuring clarity in your explanations, and validating all data and references.
5. **Ethical Compliance**:
   * Confirm that your paper complies with ethical standards, including proper attribution of sources, acknowledgments, and, if applicable, declarations of conflicts of interest or funding sources.
6. **Cover Letter**:
   * Prepare a concise and informative cover letter. This should include the significance of your work, its novelty, and why you believe it is a good fit for the journal.
7. **Response to Feedback**:
   * Be prepared to revise your paper based on feedback from preprint server discussions and peer review. Constructive and timely responses to reviewers' comments can significantly enhance the chances of your paper being accepted.
8. **Plan for Rejection or Resubmission**:
   * In case of rejection, be prepared to consider the feedback received and resubmit to another suitable journal. Rejection is a normal part of the publication process and can be used constructively to improve the paper.

Following these guidelines will help streamline the publication process and enhance the visibility and impact of your research. Remember, the journey of a manuscript from writing to publication is as important as the research itself and requires careful planning and attention to detail.
