# K: Group library

We have several technical books in the group that you can borrow (just contact Anubhav). The only condition is that you should only borrow books when you intend to read them. It is all too easy to take a book with the intention to read it and let it simply take up space on your desk for a year. So if you find yourself not using a book, just return it back.&#x20;

A list of titles and some brief notes are available on an external site: \
