# B: Purchasing a computer

Most long-term appointments (graduate student, postdoc, staff) will mean purchasing a new computer. Exceptions include:

* If you are joining an existing project for which another staff member is leaving behind a state-of-the-art computer (e.g., 1-2 years old), we may use that one instead of purchasing a new computer.
* Short-term appointments (e.g., internships) will not involve a computer purchase unless otherwise stated - you will instead receive an excellent computer from the group’s stock.

### Mac, Windows, or Linux?

You should buy a Mac, and probably a Macbook. Although this sounds extreme, and may even induce strong feelings if you are used to a different system, in practice this has never been much of a problem. Note that I am not an Apple fanatic but simply find that these are the best systems for our type of work because they contain many of the advantages of both Linux and Windows systems in a single package.&#x20;

Why not Windows? Anubhav used Windows for a very long time; it is nice, but a couple of things make it non-optimal for our work. There is no native Terminal, which you will use heavily, and programs like Cygwin are poor substitutes. Certain seemingly minor decisions made by Windows (directory slashes, line endings) are different than those from Linux, making interoperability between Linux/Mac and Windows systems more problematic (e.g., copying files to and from supercomputing centers can require converting line ending format).

Why not Linux? Linux is fine, but Microsoft Office is not available (which is used by us and most of the materials science research world) and OpenOffice is a poor substitute. Certain videoconferencing software doesn’t work well with Linux.

How about Mac? I have my complaints about it, as they are catering more to the general consumer and less to developers. Thus, you really need to spend some time setting up your Mac to make it productive for power users (see Appendix C and Appendix D on how to accomplish this). But for the moment it remains a very good compromise between Linux-like and Windows-like and thus forms the basis for our workstations.

### Preliminaries

Here is how to purchase a computer at the lab. Before we begin, a few notes:

* In terms of the mechanics of purchasing:
  * use LBNL Ebuy (not Ebay) wherever possible - you need to be on the lab network (onsite via an ethernet cable) or be connected via the VPN&#x20;
  * use Amazon, etc. to buy various components if not available via EBuy
* The laptop is government property; you are expected to return it to the group when you are done working at LBNL. Note that Mac computers make it very simple to transfer everything over to your next computer.
* You are free to take your laptop home, on trips, etc., unless you are an intern in which case other restrictions may apply from the internship program.
* The lab receives your computer and tags it before sending it over to you.

### Selecting a computer, monitor, and accessories

Your computer workstation is one area where you should just get whatever you think will make you most productive and not care about cost. Seriously, just get what is best and do not worry about cost.&#x20;

For the computer, you should select a Macbook Pro (any screen size) as mentioned above. You can use the Apple website to browse details. Anubhav uses a 13” Macbook Pro. It is powerful enough to do serious work and light/small enough to use on a plane. A 15” Macbook Pro is also a good choice. If you would like to get anything other than a Macbook Pro, talk to Anubhav.

For the monitor, Anubhav uses a single Thunderbolt display but this is no longer available. One option available is the LG 27MU88-W (4K resolution) monitor which is on Ebuy. Note that one big screen is usually better ergonomically than dual monitors, and you can use the “Spaces” feature of Mac OS/X to quickly flip between virtual screens if needed (this is what Anubhav does). Some people also opt for an extra-wide single monitor (e.g. 43”).

For accessories, make sure to get:&#x20;

* An extra charging cable
* An HDMI adapter dongle
* A Time Machine hard disk (for backup), I have currently use the Western Digital 4GB Passport for Mac
* A keyboard. I suggest Apple Wireless Keyboard since I like the feel of Mac keys and I also like a consistent feel between my laptop keyboard and my desk keyboard. If you prefer a larger or ergonomic keyboard, you can get that.
* A mouse/trackpad. I suggest Apple Magic Trackpad. Note that I’ve found that a mouse is better on Windows but a trackpad is better on Mac. The reason is because the Mac OS has really customized a lot of the interface for the trackpad (e.g., gestures). I also value consistency between my laptop and desk workstation. After awhile you get used to doing everything on your trackpad even if you were previously very productive/accurate with a mouse on Windows.
* (optional) A presentation tool, e.g., Logitech R800

### Making the purchase

* Provide all the details of your selections in an email and send to Anubhav. If all looks OK, he will give you a project and activity ID.
* Go to eBuy, and for items available there, add them to your cart and submit the requisition with the project and activity ID, and SAS approver as Amapola Comayas or Brendon Smith.
* For items not available on eBuy, contact esdradmin@lbl.gov (and cc Anubhav) to obtain a procurement form. Fill it out with item details (Vendor, website, price, etc.) and send it back to her.
* If you select the overnight shipping option (ask Anubhav about this and the related extra costs) most parts, except the computer, will arrive within a week to 10 days. The computer needs to be tagged by the lab, so with overnight shipping, it should arrive within 2 weeks. Ideally, you will select your computer well before arriving at the lab and won’t need overnight shipping.
* Note that receiving the laptop can take up to 6 weeks from the order date.
* To track your purchase, contact an administration assistant in the energy technologies area via \<esdradmin@lbl.gov>.
