# Leaving the group

If you are leaving the group, we wish the best in all your future endeavors! Some things to ensure before leaving:

* Complete and submit any papers that are close to completion
* Transfer any knowledge or code you have to others; train others to the extent possible
* Transfer any data (e.g., stored at NERSC) to others
* Retrieve any information you need from your LBNL computer accounts (email, Google Drive, etc) - your LBNL accounts will not be accessible after you leave. It’s possible to have your LBNL account extended, talk to Anubhav or human resources. For example, if you need to continue collaboration with LBNL, an affiliate status might be granted - this retains your LBNL affiliation.
* If you have any subscriptions paid for under your own account via LBNL funds (e.g., MongoDB Atlas, etc) make sure to retrieve the data and cancel those subscription OR transfer the subscription to someone else. Note that LBNL credit cards will deny charges past the initial approval dates, and this can lead to missed charges and lost data.
* If you have purchased any software subscriptions (e.g., Microsoft Office), note down the license number of those subscriptions so they can be re-used by the next person.&#x20;
* After doing everything above, clear off your computer so it can be used by someone else ([https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201065](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201065))
* Make sure that the “Exit Checkout Sheet” is filled in and handed to LBNL. Otherwise, LBNL will follow up to make sure it’s complete later on.
* Postdocs, see further instructions below

### Specific instructions for postdocs&#x20;

If you are planning to leave the group as a postdoc, please let Anubhav know as soon as possible. It usually takes 3-4 months to complete a postdoc hire at LBNL, so a standard “2 weeks notice” will mean that your project will likely go vacant for 3 months, impacting the efforts of all your collaborators and colleagues. With advance notice, we can work to make sure that your own future plans are not impacted while also making sure that all your projects and work can transition smoothly.

If you are a postdoc:

* Use the following link to submit a voluntary resignation letter: [https://bit.ly/2yptUG3](https://bit.ly/2yptUG3)&#x20;
* If you have PTOs remaining you can set your official last day as a later date than the last day you will be physically present in the lab (work with HR on this)
* If you have any questions about the exit process, you can email Human Resources at ETAHR@lbl.gov.
