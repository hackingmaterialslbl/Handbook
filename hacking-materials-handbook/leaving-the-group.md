# Leaving the group

If you are leaving the group, we wish the best in all your future endeavors! Some things to ensure before leaving:

* Let Anubhav know as soon a possible so he can begin hiring a replacement (between hiring, offer generation, visa issuance, and start, it usually takes 4–6 months to replace a position)
* Inform HR that you are leaving LBL so they know to begin your termination paperwork
* Retrieve any information you need from your LBNL computer accounts (email, Google Drive, etc) - your LBNL accounts will **not** be accessible after you leave. It’s possible to have your LBNL account extended, talk to Anubhav or human resources. For example, if you need to continue collaboration with LBNL, an affiliate status might be granted - this retains your LBNL affiliation and your access to LBL mail, Google Drive, etc.
* Transfer any cloud data (e.g., stored at NERSC) to others
* If you are not continuing as an affiliate, you may also set up e-mail forwarding for a few months so you can transition away from your LBL email
* If you have any subscriptions paid for under your own account via LBNL funds (e.g., MongoDB Atlas, ChatGPT account, etc) make sure to retrieve the data and cancel those subscription OR transfer the subscription to someone else. Note that LBNL credit cards will deny charges past the initial approval dates, and this can lead to missed charges and lost data.
* After finishing anything needed from your computer, clear off your computer so it can be used by someone else ([https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201065](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201065))
* Make sure that the “Exit Checkout Sheet” is filled in and handed to LBNL. Otherwise, LBNL will follow up to make sure it’s complete later on.
* Complete and submit any papers that are close to completion
* Transfer any knowledge or code you have to others; train others to the extent possible
