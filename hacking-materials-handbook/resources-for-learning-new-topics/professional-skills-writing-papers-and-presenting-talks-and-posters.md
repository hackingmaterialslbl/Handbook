# Professional skills: writing papers and presenting talks and posters

* If you have only a relatively short time, try this e-book from Nature Publishing Group: [http://go.nature.com/2opiiQh](http://go.nature.com/2opiiQh) . It is illustrated by Jorge Cham from PhDComics and is packed with good advice.
* I have written more about giving good presentations in Appendix G - use that for additional tips.
* If you have longer, try the book Trees, Maps, and Theorems in our group library (Appendix K). It is from the same author as the Nature e-book (Jean Luc Doumont).
