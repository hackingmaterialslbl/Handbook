# Programming and softwares

Note that there are usually many excellent resources to choose from when learning computer science topics. You usually have the flexibility of choosing to learn from a book, a video series, or even interactive tutorials like [www.learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org). Use the list below as potential starting points, but there exist many other high-quality alternatives you can find on your own and may be even better-suited to your needs.

### Python&#x20;

For pure beginners to Python, you might try the book **“Head First Python”**. It is a fun and easy introduction to Python. Beginners that know a little but not a lot of Python can also look at **“How to Make Mistakes in Python”** (ebook). For intermediate programmers, you might try **“20 Python Libraries You Aren’t Using (But Should)”** (ebook). For advanced programmers, you might try **“Expert Python Programming”**.

### Data mining and Data Analysis&#x20;

For learning basic data mining libraries (pandas, scikit-learn) as well as some skills like using git and Github, you might try the online YouTube videos from Kevin Markham, an educator at Data School. These videos also do a good job of pointing you to supplementary material: [https://www.youtube.com/user/dataschool](https://www.youtube.com/user/dataschool) \

You might also try the book **“Python for Data Science For Dummies”** (please note: this is different than “Data Science for Dummies”).&#x20;

Data 100/200 offered by UC Berkeley is also a good source to learn almost all skills you need to do data analysis. The lecture records and slides are published online: [https://ds100.org/](https://ds100.org/)&#x20;

For a more materials-centric view, you can try working your way through the Machine Learning In Materials tutorial in the Appendix of this handbook.

A very comprehensive set of suggestions for further resources is listed here: \

### MongoDb&#x20;

A (now somewhat old, but still clear) resource for beginning to use MongoDb is the “The Little MongoDB Book”: \

There is also an extensive library of webinars on MongoDb on their official web site.
