# Our computing systems

Our groupâ€™s main computing resources are:&#x20;

* NERSC (the LBNL supercomputing center, one of the biggest in the world)&#x20;
* Lawrencium (our group owns 4 dedicated nodes on this cluster)&#x20;
* Eagle Computing System at NREL (for projects funded by DOE EERE)&#x20;
* Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (sometimes)&#x20;
* Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (sometimes)&#x20;

At any time, if you feel you are computing-limited, please contact Anubhav so he can work with you on finding solutions.
