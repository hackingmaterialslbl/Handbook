# D: ALCF and OLCF

Both ALCF and OLCF are “leadership computing facilities” meaning that they operate some of the fastest computers in the world. The strength of these facilities is that they offer very large amounts of computer time available for users; the weakness is that is much more difficult to use these computers. Therefore, it is generally only worth using these resources if you have a significant amount of computing to do (i.e., at least 1 million CPU-hours). Contact Anubhav if you think an account on ALCF or OLCF would be useful.
