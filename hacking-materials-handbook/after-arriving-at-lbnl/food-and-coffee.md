# Food and coffee

There is a common kitchen in building 62 with microwave, fridge, and coffee machine. I donâ€™t know who the coffee machine belongs to but you can try to make friends with whomever that is. There is a coffee machine in the 2nd floor of Molecular Foundry ($1/cup or $15/month) that some of the other postdocs in the group can tell you more details about. For emergency coffee situations, Anubhav has an espresso machine in his office that you can borrow (but wait for the go-ahead to come in, since he is often in the middle of a videoconference).

There are no vending machines in building 62, but if you go down to the first floor you walk to building 66 and there are some vending machines on the bottom floor. There are also some vending machines on the bottom floor of 67 (Molecular Foundry).

The only real food is in the lab cafe, which is about a 15 minute walk from our building. The menu is posted at (some items change weekly):&#x20;
