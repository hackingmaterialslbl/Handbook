# Food and coffee

In the past, the lab had a dedicated cafeteria with a coffee shop. However, things are currently in flux as the cafeteria is completely closed for renovations.

The latest information regarding food and coffee are listed at [here](https://food.lbl.gov).

Within the building, there are vending machines scattered throughout. The research group of Kristin Persson has a coffee machine, contact Anubhav if you are interested.
