# Other issues

If you are struggling with stress or other personal problems, you can contact the LBNL Employee Assistance Program (EAP), which provides free and confidential counseling, consultation, and referral for LBNL staff. If you are comfortable doing so, you can also discuss the problem with Anubhav to brainstorm if there are ways forward.
