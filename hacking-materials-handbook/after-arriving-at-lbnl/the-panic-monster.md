# The Panic Monster

The Panic Monster is a red doll in Anubhav’s office based on a blog post from Wait But Why. If you see the Panic Monster on Anubhav’s desk, it is best not to bother him. If you see the Panic Monster on your desk, it means you have lots of work to catch up on and you need to get working! If you do happen to get a visit from the panic monster, fret not; a day or two of dedicated catch-up work is usually enough to chase him off.
