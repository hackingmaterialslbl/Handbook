# Equipment and conference rooms

Anyone can reserve conference rooms through the LBNL Google calendar. Make sure you are logged in to your lbl.gov account.To book a room, add an event to your own Google Calendar (first) and use the option within Google calendar to add a room (in the detailed options for the calendar event). You will see a list of LBNL rooms displayed. Note that when adding a room, you will see a number in parenthesis like (20) - that is approximately the number of people that the room can accommodate, giving you a sense of the room size.

To see the availability of one or more conference rooms over time for planning purposes, note that each conference room has its own Google calendar. Just add the conference room’s calendar to your list of calendars (find the area that says “Other calendars” and then type the room into “Add coworker’s calendar”).&#x20;

Most conference rooms now are set up for Zoom teleconferencing so that they can be run as hybrid meetings. The Zoom set up can also be used to share slides, presentations, etc. in the meeting.
