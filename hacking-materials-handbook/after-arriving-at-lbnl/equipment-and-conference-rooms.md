# Equipment and conference rooms

Should you need it, Anubhav has a projector that you can borrow. If he is not in the office, feel free to go in and just grab it (it is visible on the gray shelf). Just leave a note and remember to return it.

Anyone can reserve conference rooms through the LBNL Google calendar. Make sure you are logged in to your lbl.gov account.To book a room, add an event to your own Google Calendar (first) and use the option within Google calendar to add a room (in the detailed options for the calendar event). You will see a list of LBNL rooms displayed. e.g., 62-203 (big main room) and 62-253 (smaller room with poor wi-fi). Note that when adding a room, you will see a number in parenthesis like (20) - that is approximately the number of people that the room can accommodate, giving you a sense of the room size. To see the availability of one or more conference rooms over time for planning purposes, note that each conference room has its own Google calendar. Just add the conference room’s calendar to your list of calendars (find the area that says “Other calendars” and then type the room into “Add coworker’s calendar”).
