# Postdoc union

Note that Berkeley postdocs have unionized with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America to obtain collective bargaining agreements. Joining the union is an option, and many of the details are present here: [http://uaw5810.org](http://uaw5810.org) You can also message the Slack group to get opinions from the current postdocs in the group.

Note that graduate students are now also eligible to be part of the same union.
