# Foreign travel

In many respects, LBL is similar to academic institutions. However, when it comes to foreign travel (non-vacation), it is quite different**. There are very strict procedures if you wish to work on projects / conduct professional activities while not in the U.S., whether that is for an international conference or hoping to workremotely while in a foreign country.**&#x20;

**Even if you are going on vacation to a foreign country, if you plan to bring your DOE laptop with you or to do some work while abroad, there are procedures to follow.** Namely, nowadays there is an [Export Control](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/126a9c2415784e2ca2b033ed3794d5cd) form to fill out.

**Foreign travel has been responsible for some of the most severe practical problems in our research group over the past few years.** This included things like not getting proper approval to travel to an international conference (there is a long procedure) and attempting to work from abroad for long periods of time (not allowed).

If you are planning on traveling to a foreign country, please schedule a meeting with Anubhav as soon as you can about it and we can discuss how to avoid the kinds of issues we have had in the past.
