# Mail and fax

The incoming and outgoing mail corridor is located in building 62, second floor. You can find an empty slot and put your name there; sometimes, your mail will end up there, other times your mail will just end up in a common pile, so you may need to check both. Please do not have any personal (non-business related) mail sent to your LBNL address - this is not allowed.

If you would like to mail something internally (including the benefits office, which is not on the hill), first get an envelope either from 62-309 or from building 66 (room 237-250, make a left right after entering). Scratch off all the previous mail stops and write down the destination mail stop ( something like: 90P-0101 ) and then put it in the outgoing mailbox in the mail corridor in 62. There are also some miscellaneous mailing supplies in 62-309 on the shelves.

There is a fax machine in 62-309. For outside numbers, dial 9 first, then the country code (1), then the rest of the number.
