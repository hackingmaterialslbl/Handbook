# What to do if you’re sick

If you’re sick, _**do not come to the office**_. This is very important; otherwise, you can get others sick and potentially bring down the productivity of the entire group. Instead, work from home or take a sick day to rest, relax, and recover. Simply e-mail Anubhav and let him know what you’re doing. Just don’t come into the office!
