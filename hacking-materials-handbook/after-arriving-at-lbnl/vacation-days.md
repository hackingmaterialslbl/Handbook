# Vacation days

You will receive a set number of vacation / personal time off (PTO) days that will be outlined in your hiring package. For union postdocs, the union has currently negotiated 24 PTO days per year (in addition to standard lab holidays) along with other benefits.

You should coordinate the specific days of vacation and personal time off with Anubhav, especially for an extended absence
