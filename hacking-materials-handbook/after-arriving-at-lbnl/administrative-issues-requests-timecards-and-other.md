# Administrative issues - requests, timecards, and other

## General administrative requests

There are now standard procedures how to navigate various administrative items (e.g., requesting a key to your office, requesting conference travel, etc.) at the [esdradmin](https://sites.google.com/a/lbl.gov/esdradmin/) web site. You will need to be logged in to your LBL Google Account (and perhaps on LBNL network or VPN) to access it.

## LETS timecard

Every month, you are required to fill out your timecard at [https://lets.lbl.gov](https://lets.lbl.gov). This is mostly straightforward but here are a few pointers:&#x20;

* To fill out your work hours, leave “Earning Type” as Regular and “Shift” as 1. For project id, activity id, and days, use the information Anubhav gives you. You do _**not**_ need to fill out the work/job number or the specific days on which you worked.
*   For sick or vacation days, set “Earnings Type” to the appropriate value. You will need to enter both the number of days as well as the specific dates that you took sick leave/vacation. If you took vacation or sick days, simply deduct those number of days from

    your project (proportionally if you have multiple projects).
* In total, the number of days should match the “Work days” listed in the top-left. Note that if it is your first or last month in the group, this might not be true if you join/leave mid-month.
* When finished, click “Run Report”, then “Release”.
* Note that your “Leave Balance” in the bottom-left assumes 8 hours per day.

## Other issues

If you are struggling with stress or other personal problems, you can contact the LBNL Employee Assistance Program (EAP), which provides free and confidential counseling, consultation, and referral for LBNL staff. If you are comfortable doing so, you can also discuss the problem with Anubhav to brainstorm if there are ways forward.
