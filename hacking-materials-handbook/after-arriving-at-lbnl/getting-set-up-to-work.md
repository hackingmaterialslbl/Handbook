# Getting set up to work

Here is a checklist of things you should complete within your first week:

* **Set up your computer.** See Appendix documentation on how to do this and some recommended software to install.&#x20;
* **Request to be added to the group email list.** Alex Dunn can add you to hackmat@lists.lbl.gov
* **Complete the checklist that HR gives you in your welcome package.** Note: postdocs cannot select retirement plans; an obligatory UCRS DCP is deducted from your pre-tax salary each month but the money belongs to you.&#x20;
* **Complete all LBNL training courses.**&#x20;
* **Set up the employee wifi.** Note that the visitor wifi is open access. To connect to employee wifi, go to [https://software.lbl.gov/](https://software.lbl.gov/), search for “Wireless Networking”, and download the configuration file.&#x20;
* **Request access to the group’s Google Drive folder.**&#x20;
* **Install VPN for connecting to the lab network from home.** For example, this lets you download research articles from home. See https://software.lbl.gov for instructions on installation.&#x20;
* **Obtain user accounts for any computing resources you may be using.** See documentation later in this handbook.&#x20;
* **Schedule a 30-minute biweekly meeting time with Anubhav.** Ask about any other meetings.&#x20;
* **Obtain a license for any software packages you might be using.** For example, you may need to be added to the VASP users list (for VASP, you should also register for the forum.)&#x20;
* **Set up the printer.** The printer is located in the corner of the third floor of building 62 near the water fountain. Follow instructions at http://bit.ly/2sB6yIX to connect. Note: if you are having issues connecting to the printer, ensure during setup that the connection protocol being used is Line Printing Daemon - LDP. Mac may default to IPP instead which will not work. The name of the printer is ms-div-copyprnt3.lbl.gov.&#x20;
* **Request after-hours access.** By default, you will not have off-hours site access to building 62, i.e., on weekends, holidays, and from \~6pm to 7am on weekdays. To obtain off-hours site access, email the ESDR admin (esdradmin@lbl.gov), tell them you need after-hours building access, and cc Anubhav.
* **Ask to read the proposal that funds your work.** This will help explain the impact of your project, the long-term plans and goals, and how your project fits in with other efforts.&#x20;
* **Have your picture taken for the group website.** Coordinate a time with Anubhav, who will take the picture.&#x20;
* **Update your name tag outside your office.** Contact Charlotte Standish for help if needed.&#x20;
* **Get a key to your office.** See http://bit.ly/2vGGWe9&#x20;
* **Add your name to the 62-203 mail room.** Note that interns and short-term visitors do not need to do this.&#x20;
* **Say “hi” to your neighbors!** Working here will be more pleasant if you get to know some of the people around you. One good time to introduce yourself is when you see people eating lunch in the kitchen area.&#x20;
* **Send Anubhav an email confirming you have completed everything on this list.**
