# Software help groups

If you have problems with software, and in particular the software maintained by our group and our collaborators, you should contact the appropriate help group. The documentation for the software will list what that channel is; if not, try the Github Issues page. If you contact Anubhav, make sure you address the four questions above as well as provide everything needed (files, test code, etc) to quickly reproduce and debug the problem.&#x20;

Two other ways to get software help that are more self-guided are:

* If you are having trouble using a particular class or function, look for unit tests within the code, which often demonstrate how to use the class or function
* If the class or function has a unique name (e.g., MaterialsProjectCompatibility), another option is to both Google and search on github.com for the particular class/function. The github.com search will often reveal code snippets from users all around the world.
