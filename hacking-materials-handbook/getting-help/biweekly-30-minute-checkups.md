# Biweekly 30-minute checkups

Anubhav will schedule a time to check up with you every other week for 30 minutes (if you are an undergraduate, the schedule may be different). You do not need to present slides or prepare any formal presentation. Some of the things you can do during these checkups:

* mention anything that is impeding your progress (e.g., lack of equipment, lack of response from a collaborator, long queue wait times at supercomputer, etc.)
* report what you worked on the last week and present your goals for the next week, month, or 3 months to confirm that you are on the right track, not repeating previous work, etc.
* introduce a major problem you are facing and that requires a longer, targeted meeting to brainstorm a solution (just present the problem in enough detail)
* solve very small problems, such as getting feedback on 3-4 presentation slides
* request a decision about something
