# Open science and arxiv / chemrxiv

Open access to our research is beneficial for both authors and readers.&#x20;

The Department of Energy agrees and has issued an Open Access Policy (sometimes referred to as a Public Access Plan) that stipulates that the products of our research should be made available open access within 12 months of publication, aligning with our group's values as well.

Here is our group's policy:

**When you submit a paper to an academic journal, you (**_**i.e.**_**, the first author) should also submit the manuscript at the same time to one of (in order of decreasing preference): chemrxiv,  arxiv, OSTI's preprint server.** Revisions to the paper (before the journal formatting stage) should also be uploaded / updated to the chosen preprint server. The final formatted version (i.e., journal formatted) should not be uploaded.

If our group is on a collaborative paper and no one in our group is the first author, the schedule of public access would depend on the corresponding author.  However, if the corresponding author's group has not shared the manuscript on a preprint server within 12 months, our group needs to do so. Responsibility would fall to the earliest author in our group to deposit the latest version of the manuscript _prior_ to journal formatting.

Finally, in rare cases, we may ourselves choose to hold off sharing the preprint until after formal publication â€“ this is sometimes the case for high-impact work where press releases are involved and need to be coordinated with the release of the work.  Anubhav will let you know if you fall into such a case.
