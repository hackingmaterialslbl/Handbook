# Our software stack

A brief summary of our software stack includes:&#x20;

* **pymatgen / pymatgen-db** - for representing and analyzing crystal structures, as well as setting up/performing manual calculations&#x20;
* **FireWorks** - for executing and managing calculation workflows at supercomputing centers&#x20;
* **custodian** - instead of directly running an executable like VASP, one can wrap the executable in custodian to detect and fix errors&#x20;
* **atomate** - for quickly defining multiple types of materials science workflows&#x20;
* **matminer/automatminer** - for large data analysis and visualization

We also heavily use the Materials Project database.&#x20;

To learn how to use the software stack, you can consult the documentation of the individual codebases as well as review the following resources:&#x20;
