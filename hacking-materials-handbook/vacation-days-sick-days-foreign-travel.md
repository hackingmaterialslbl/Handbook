# Vacation days, sick days, foreign travel

## Vacation days

You will receive a set number of vacation / personal time off (PTO) days that will be outlined in your hiring package. You should coordinate the specific days of vacation and personal time off with Anubhav, especially for an extended absence.

Note that accurate reporting of your vacation days is important for not only for legal reasons but because it has real implications on our group's research budget. When postdocs and graduate students report vacation days, those days are not charged to our group's research budget – allowing the research budget that is saved to be spent on other things.

**If your vacation involves foreign travel, see the section on foreign travel as soon as possible - this is very important, do not skip this!**

## Sick days

If you’re sick, _**do not come to the office**_. This is very important; otherwise, you can get others sick and potentially bring down the productivity of the entire group. Instead, work from home or take a sick day to rest, relax, and recover. Simply e-mail Anubhav and let him know what you’re doing.&#x20;

Just don’t come into the office!

## Foreign travel on vacation

In many respects, LBL is similar to academic institutions. However, when it comes to foreign travel, it is quite different**. There are very strict procedures if you wish to work on projects / conduct professional activities while not in the U.S., whether that is for an international conference or hoping to work remotely while in a foreign country.**&#x20;

**Even if you are going on vacation to a foreign country, if you plan to bring your DOE laptop with you or to do some work while abroad, there are procedures to follow.** Namely, nowadays there is an [Export Control](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/126a9c2415784e2ca2b033ed3794d5cd) form to fill out.

Furthermore, if you are stranded in a foreign country while on vacation, you may be put on leave without pay until you return to the United States.

If you are planning on traveling to a foreign country, please schedule a meeting with Anubhav as soon as possible so we can discuss the various policies.
