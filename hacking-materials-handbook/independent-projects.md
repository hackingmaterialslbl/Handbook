# Independent projects

_“You’ll learn infinitely better and easier and more completely by picking a problem for yourself that you find interesting to fiddle around with, some kind of thing that you heard that you don’t understand, or you want to analyze further, or want to do some kind of trick with - that’s the best way to learn something”._

**-- Richard Feynman**

_“...it is certainly all right and potentially very productive just to mess around. Quick uncontrolled experiments are very productive. They are performed just to see if you can make something interesting happen”._

**-- E.O. Wilson**

You may have ideas for research that deviate somewhat from the scope of your official work. If you are interested in conducting an independent project or trying a new idea, talk to Anubhav! If it is in the group interest, we can try to make it happen.

The main metric for a successful pitch is having a plan to prototype and test an idea (e.g., by gathering data) in a rapid fashion.
