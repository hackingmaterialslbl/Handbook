description: Welcome to Berkeley! Here are a few pointers for getting started.

# After arriving at LBNL

Here is a checklist of things you should complete within your first week:

* **Set up your computer.** See Appendix documentation on how to do this and some recommended software to install.&#x20;
* **Request to be added to the group email list.** Anubhav can add you to hackmat@lists.lbl.gov
* **Complete the checklist that HR gives you in your welcome package.** Note: postdocs cannot select retirement plans; an obligatory UCRS DCP is deducted from your pre-tax salary each month but the money belongs to you.&#x20;
* **Work with an "onboarder" in the group to check off necessary items.** See more information [here](https://onboarding.lbl.gov/im-an-onboarder).
* **Review the "Resources" on the Berkeley Lab onboarding web site.** It can be found [here](https://onboarding.lbl.gov/resources).
* **Complete all LBNL training courses.**&#x20;
* **Set up the employee wifi.** Note that the visitor wifi is open access. To connect to employee wifi, go to [https://software.lbl.gov/](https://software.lbl.gov/), search for “Wireless Networking”, and follow the instructions.
* **Request access to the group’s Google Drive folder.** There are many additional resources there.
* **Install VPN for connecting to the lab network from home.** For example, this lets you download research articles from home. See https://software.lbl.gov for instructions on installation.&#x20;
* **Obtain user accounts for any computing resources you may be using.** See documentation later in this handbook.&#x20;
* **Obtain a license for any software packages you might be using.** For example, you may need to be added to the VASP users list.
* **Schedule a 30-minute biweekly meeting time with Anubhav.** Ask about any other meetings.&#x20;
* **Set up the printer (optional).** There are wireless printers on the first floor of building 33 near the kitchen. The IP address of the printers are indicated on the printer, which allow you to connect to them via wireless.
* **Request after-hours access.** By default, may not have off-hours site access to building 33, i.e., on weekends, holidays, and from \~8pm to 7am on weekdays. To obtain off-hours site access:
  1. Go to access.lbl.gov
  2. Click on "Area Request" at the top of the Dashboard
  3. In the search bar, type 33 and select "33-Perimeter", (not 33-perimeter M-F 8A-5P) which you likely already have
  4. Then click the "ADD" button on the right, and the "DONE" button at the top.
  5. Do step 2 - 4 for any other buildings may need access to.
* **Ask to read the proposal that funds your work.** This will help explain the impact of your project, the long-term plans and goals, and how your project fits in with other efforts.&#x20;
* **Have your picture taken for the group website.** Coordinate a time with Anubhav, who will take the picture.&#x20;
* **Familiarize yourself with the lab's A-Z site.** The site is [here](https://a-z.lbl.gov) and has answers to most procedure questions; for example start typing "conference room" to find out about conference rooms.
* **Familiarize yourself with the division web site for administrative requests.** There are now standard procedures how to navigate various administrative items (e.g., requesting a key to your office, requesting conference travel, etc.) at the [esdradmin](https://sites.google.com/a/lbl.gov/esdradmin/) web site. You will need to be logged in to your LBL Google Account (and perhaps on LBNL network or VPN) to access it.
* **Set up your office.** &#x20;
* **Say “hi” to your neighbors!** Working here will be more pleasant if you get to know some of the people around you. One good time to introduce yourself is when you see people eating lunch in the kitchen area. We also try to coordinate occasional mixed group lunches between the people in the group.
* **Send Anubhav an email confirming you have completed everything on this list.**
