# Places to work outside of your office

Anubhav is much more interested in your research output than where you work. Indeed, one of the advantages of choosing computational science as a career is that it can afford you some more flexibility location-wise than other jobs. Overall, you are encouraged to work where you feel best _from time-to-time_ to maximize your energy and productivity. The more accurate policy is that the more productive you are in terms of output (see “questions for self assessment” section), the less Anubhav cares about where you are doing your work. If you do end up spending a day working elsewhere, follow these rules:

1. Let me know when in advance and also your collaborators
2. Get your work done
3. Be available, e.g., don’t miss meetings and keep an eye on your email
4. Overcommunicate (i.e., send me an email with your progress for the day)

_When those rules are followed (particularly the last one), there is usually no problem in working outside your office from time to time. Indeed, this handbook even tells you where you might go._

Some places to work apart from your office include:&#x20;

* The Molecular Foundry 3rd floor lounge&#x20;
* The LBNL coffee shop and library reading room (downstairs from the cafeteria cash register area)
* The UC Botanical Garden and Redwood Grove (free admission for LBNL)
* UC Berkeley campus, including the Free Speech Movement cafe which has rotating newspaper headlines
* Downtown and campus-area coffee shops&#x20;
