# LETS timecard

Every month, you are required to fill out your timecard at [https://lets.lbl.gov](https://lets.lbl.gov). This is mostly straightforward but here are a few pointers:&#x20;

* To fill out your work hours, leave “Earning Type” as Regular and “Shift” as 1. For project id, activity id, and days, use the information Anubhav gives you. You do _**not**_ need to fill out the work/job number or the specific days on which you worked.
*   For sick or vacation days, set “Earnings Type” to the appropriate value. You will need to enter both the number of days as well as the specific dates that you took sick leave/vacation. If you took vacation or sick days, simply deduct those number of days from

    your project (proportionally if you have multiple projects).
* In total, the number of days should match the “Work days” listed in the top-left. Note that if it is your first or last month in the group, this might not be true if you join/leave mid-month.
* When finished, click “Run Report”, then “Release”.
* Note that your “Leave Balance” in the bottom-left assumes 8 hours per day.
