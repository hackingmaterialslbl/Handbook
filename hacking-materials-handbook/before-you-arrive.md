  Although many things can only be taken care of after arriving at LBNL, here
  are a few simple things you should do in advance.

# Before you arrive

* **Join the Slack group!** The berkeleytheory Slack group spans several research groups at LBNL. There are channels to ask housing questions, programming questions, science discussion, and general hijinx, and a dedicated #hackmat channel for our group. **How? Contact Anubhav - he’ll introduce you.**
* **Order a computer!** Postdocs and graduate students - let’s order your workstation in advance so that it’s ready by the time you arrive. **How? See Appendix on purchasing a computer.**
* **Find a place to live!** Berkeley and the surrounding areas are wonderful places to live, but finding an apartment can be difficult and is best done with knowledge of the various neighborhoods. **How? See Appendix on housing.**
