  Although many things can only be taken care of after arriving at LBNL, here
  are a few simple things you should do in advance.

# Before you arrive

* **Review the onboarding instructions!** Review Berkeley Lab's [onboarding](https://onboarding.lbl.gov) instructions, including a [checklist ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eVvND1LQizVmyTiB2D4QVREYYzfRUR5O0ugtBGgVFds/edit#gid=365351431)that has tabs for what to do before arriving.
* **Join the Slack group!** The berkeleytheory Slack group spans several research groups at LBNL. There are channels to ask housing questions, programming questions, science discussion, and general hijinx, and a dedicated #hackmat channel for our group. **How? Contact Anubhav - heâ€™ll introduce you.**
* **Order a computer!** It can take a few weeks for the computer to arrive, so this should be done before starting at the lab. See Appendix section on how to do so.
* **Find a place to live!** Berkeley and the surrounding areas are wonderful places to live, but finding an apartment can be difficult and is best done with knowledge of the various neighborhoods. **How? See section on Finding a place to live.**
