# Telework

It can happen that you are required to work from home for a long period without a possibility to visit the main site. You probably can move for that period somewhere else inside the US (international telework is highly likely not an option, talk to Anubhav first). If it happens, here is a list of things that may be useful for you:

* Check time zones - all your work still happens on Berkeley time - and update your LBNL google calendar with time when you may be unavailable.
* Make sure that you have a comfortable working place at home - ergonomics is very important as you will move less than before. If you need something from your office you can check if you can take it home with you.
* Make sure that you have a cozy working space - you should feel nice there and want to come back every day. Hygge concepts may help.
* Try to organize a working schedule with time tracking apps like Pomodoro or Toggle and virtual task boards like Trello or Miro.
* Maybe it is time to start using the Bullet Journal Method?&#x20;
* Podcasts and blogs can give you some tips on work from home.
