# Telework

## Policy

In general, Anubhav is much more interested in your research output than where you work. Indeed, one of the advantages of choosing computational science as a career is that it can afford you some more flexibility location-wise than other jobs. Nevertheless, when it comes to working with others, in-person interaction is generally much more productive than Zoom calls. Furthermore, it is much easier to get to know your colleagues in person than it is to do so while working from home.

Some times when you are **required** to be at the lab, unless otherwise arranged, are:

* At our biweekly 1:1 meetings
* At our biweekly "Teach Me Anything" group meetings
* For our biannual "Group Days"
* For project-specific meetings that occur in person

## Telework equipment

Note that it may be possible to purchase some telework equipment with lab funds. Contact Anubhav if interested. There are also some links at the [LBL telework page](https://telework.lbl.gov).

## Other places to work

If you just need a break from your desk, some places to work apart from your office include:&#x20;

* Building 33's patio connected to 33-240B conference room
* Building 33's 3rd floor conference room, which has spectacular views of the bay
* The Molecular Foundry 3rd floor lounge&#x20;
* The LBNL coffee shop and library reading room (downstairs from the cafeteria cash register area) - _note: this is currently closed due to the cafeteria renovation_
* The UC Botanical Garden and Redwood Grove (free admission for LBNL)
* UC Berkeley campus, including the Free Speech Movement cafe which has rotating newspaper headlines
* Downtown and campus-area coffee shops&#x20;
