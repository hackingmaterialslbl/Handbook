# Longer meetings by appointment

Longer, targeted meetings are welcome so long as you have a clear purpose for them. In particular, if a difficult decision needs to be made or you’d like to brainstorm a technical problem, a longer meeting will almost certainly work better than e-mail. To schedule a targeted meeting, you should first e-mail me and tell me why you’d like to meet (or simply describe your need at a 30-minute meeting). If a meeting is in fact the best solution, we will work out a time and place to have the meeting. You can use Anubhav’s public calendar to suggest a few possible times. The best way is to add his calendar to yours through LBNL Google Calendar (see instructions in the section about Booking Conference Rooms). Another way is to access his calendar through this public link: [http://bit.ly/2ncHcPo](http://bit.ly/2ncHcPo)
