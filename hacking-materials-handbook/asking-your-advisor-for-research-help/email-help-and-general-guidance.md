# Email help (and general guidance)

> _If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions. -- Albert Einstein_

**Note:** Anubhav does not respond to direct messages on Slack - help is through email or meetings only.

From time to time, you will encounter problems, require suggestions, or otherwise need assistance from your advisor. This is normal, and asking for help is encouraged so long as you have done your best to solve the problem yourself. Sadly, it is all too easy these days to send e-mails without first investigating a problem yourself, and it is important to remember that your advisor gets many dozens of emails per day. Thus, if the question is truly important and difficult, you should take the time to address the following four questions\[1] in your email:

* [ ] What is the problem? \
  Clearly describe the problem, starting from the beginning.&#x20;
* [ ] What is the CAUSE of the problem? \
  For example, your immediate problem may be that you need more computing time. But the cause of your problem is perhaps that you want to determine the best ordering of a disordered compound and that you anticipate that this will require running many calculations. If you are unsure how to answer this question, ask yourself “why” this problem needs to be solved (some companies such as Toyota employ the “5 Whys” principle - i.e., asking “why” 5 consecutive times to get to the root of the problem rather than fix surface issues).
* [ ] What are all the possible solutions to the problem? You might think this means list a couple of possible solutions. That’s not what this means. This means list all possible solutions - every single way the problem could be solved. This includes unconventional options, options that you may not know how to implement or think might not work. If you don’t have any solution ideas, list all the avenues you tried (e.g., Google search terms) to find one. If you already tried some solutions but they failed, summarize that information here.
* [ ] What solution do you suggest? Provide your reason for suggesting this solution. \
  More often than not, taking the time to answer these questions leads to you solving your own problem. In the cases where that is not true, these responses will make brainstorming solutions to your problem more effective and will also allow Anubhav to provide feedback into your process of generating all possible solutions.
